TODO: Most of these are trivial changes upon PVLIB functions (input format and parsing), that should be merged and marked as changes from to the originals.

Cases where changes are more dramatic (e.g. dividing the Perez model into several functions) still must be propperly documented, and perhaps moved outside of the library.
